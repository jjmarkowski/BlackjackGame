BlackjackGame
=============
1. If cards are being displayed for the human or dealer and the new game button is hit the cards aren't removed.
2. The layout of the panels and buttons.
3. Multiple classes can be linked together allowing a program to use different classed in order to do different things.
4. Public variables are visable to all classes while private variables are only visable to the class it belongs to. A public method can be called from any class, but a private method can only be called from the calls that it is in.
5. The class is like the blueprint of and object and an instance is an object that is a particular instance of a class.
6. Inheritance is taking behaviors and states from a particular class to be used in a subclass.  This allows for superclasses to be used to create an unlimited amount of subclasses that have similar information.
7. "Super" allows a subclass to run a method of a superclass. "This" allows a particular instance to call the constructor in another class.
8. The two properties of objects is the behavior and the state.
9. I am still confused a little bit about how superclasses and subclasses interact.
